##  Title of the Project

**Shipment Management Form using HTML, JavaScript, and JsonPowerDB**

---

##  Description

This project is a responsive and interactive shipment data entry form built using **HTML**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**, connected to **JsonPowerDB**. It allows the user to insert and update shipment records based on a primary key (`Shipment-No`), making it ideal for small logistics or delivery-related applications.

The form communicates with JPDB using the `PUT` (Replace) and `GET_BY_KEY` APIs to save or update records dynamically without reloading the page.
